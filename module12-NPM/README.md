1.  npm init -y <br>
    this created a package.json file automatically with all details of the project.<br>
2.  npm install loadash <br> 
    this installed loadash library to my project and added it to dependencies in package.json <br>
    and this also created a node_modules directory and added loadash to it.<br>
3.  created an account on npm and logged in through npm login.<br>
4.  used lodash library in my script and did an operation to verify the installation.<br>
